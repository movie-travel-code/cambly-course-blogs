In this blogs I will talk about my impression about the countries based on the wars and the communications between the countries and China. 

War can bring indelible memories to the people, like [Hundred Years' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War), [Russo-Polish War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Polish_War_(1654%E2%80%931667)), [Babylonian captivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity), [Armenian Genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Genocide). Jewish wrote the Cyrus the Great in the Bible for th and 

> According to the Bible, Cyrus the Great, king of [Persia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire), was the monarch under whom the [Babylonian captivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity) ended. In the first year of his reign he was prompted by God to decree that the [Temple in Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_in_Jerusalem) should be rebuilt and that such Jews as cared to might return to their land for this purpose. - <Cyrus the Great in the Bible>

Communications can bring about the similar cultures, like east asian can easily to understand and apperciate each other's art.

The list about the war between ancient China and Japan:

- Battle of Baekgang
  - Date 27–28 August 663 CE
  - Location Lower reaches of the Geum River Korea
- Mongol invasions of Japan
  - Date 1274, 1281
  - Location Northern Japan
- Japanese invasions of Korea
  - May 23, 1592 – December 24, 1598
  - [Korean Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Peninsula)
- First Sino-Japanese War
- Second Sino-Japanese War

The ancient wars actually have no influence on the thoughts of Chinese, because they are far from now. But the last two wars have the tremendous impact on modern Chinese.

### First Sino-Japanese War

The **First Sino-Japanese War** (25 July 1894 – 17 April 1895) was fought between [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty) and [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan) primarily over influence in [Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseon). End of the war, signed the [Treaty of Shimonoseki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Shimonoseki) on 17 April 1895.

The Qing government paid a total of 340,000,000 taels (13,600 tons) of silver to Japan, and cede of Taiwan. The usage of the silver as bellow:

- 62.71 % Arms expansion

- 5.5% civil list

After this war, Japan has officially risen.

### Second Sino-Japanese War

The **Second Sino-Japanese War** was a military conflict fought primarily between the [Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China_(1912%E2%80%931949)) and the [Empire of Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan) from July 7, 1937, to September 2, 1945.

It is a part of the second World War, 

## The communication between Japan and China
