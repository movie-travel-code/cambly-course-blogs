During this period, new ways of thinking appeared in Persia, India, China, and the Greco-Roman world in religion and philosophy, in striking parallel development. In this period, India produced Buddha, Greece produced Plato, and China produced many schools of thought, including Taoism, Confucianism, Legalism. These three schools of thought have a profound influence on the ways Chinese people thinking. Espically, the Confucianism and Taoism.

# Confucianism

The creator of Confucianism is Confucius, lived from 551 B.C. to 479 B.C, he was a teacher and has so many well-known saying, like "A wise man will not fancy he knows what he does not know.", "Make no social distinctions in Teaching" and "Teach students in accordance with their aptitude".

But what make so well-known not just because he came up with so many well-known sayings, but also because he create the Confucianism.

## Confucius's moral system

Because Confucius lived at a warring age, he saw many human tragedies caused by war, so he thought we should love each other, he said **we should expand the respect of the aged in one's family to that of other families; expand the love of the young ones in one's family to that of other families**.

This theory is derived from family, or rather **filial piety**. If we love my relatives, why we can't love strangers. If everyone thinks so, the world will be very beautiful.
