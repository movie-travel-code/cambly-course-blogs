# Difference

## capability vs ability

- Meaning there are limits to everyone’s abilities, and your capability defines the limit of your ability. Furthermore, capability can be influenced by external factors. For instance, I have the ability to walk, but am incapable of walking up the side of a building. I have the ability to drive, but am incapable of driving without a vehicle.
