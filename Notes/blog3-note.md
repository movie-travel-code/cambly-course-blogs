# Difference

## capability vs ability

- To have the ability to do something means you are able to carry out the task, while having the capability to do it means you have the potential to do the task but you may not have mastered the skill yet.
- Meaning there are limits to everyone’s abilities, and your capability defines the limit of your ability. Furthermore, capability can be influenced by external factors. For instance, I have the ability to walk, but am incapable of walking up the side of a building. I have the ability to drive, but am incapable of driving without a vehicle.
